\title{Lab 3: Interrupts }
\begin{document}
\maketitle

\paragraph{}
For this lab, the main focus was on interrupts and how the ARM architecture handles them. We continued using the vector table, learned what interrupts were, and how they related to hardware buttons. We kept learning about the different registers, and how they may be affected by interrupts. 

\paragraph{}
The vector table again played a major part in this lab. For completeness, the vector table addresses were listed in the \textit{statup.s} file, see the example below. Make sure to note the SysTick\_Handler as it comes up later in the program.

To start, we had a program that simply looped for ever. 
\lstset{language=[x86masm]Assembler}
\begin{lstlisting}
B       .               ; Pretend the processor is gainfully occupied.
\end{lstlisting}	
As the comment implies, this is to simulate a computer performing actions, like running another program, or receiving input from a keyboard. 

Before the infinite loop, the program did a few other tasks, like initializing the GPIO ports, and the interrupts associated with those ports.  

\paragraph{}
To see how ports are initialized, lets inspect the \textit{GPIOF\_Init} branch. It starts by using the \textit{LDR} [WHATS THIS?] instruction to move SYSCTL\_GPIOHBCTL\_R into R0. 

Continuing through the rest of this branch, it continues to set different values which are essentially defaults to set up the Input Output controller for the switch we want.

\paragraph{}
Next, we need the Interrupts for our button to be configured. An hardware interrupt is a signal from a device, in this case a button, to the processor that it needs immediate attention. The most obvious example of an interrupt on a normal computer is a keyboard, when you tap a key, it sends a signal to the processor that it needs attention, which then communicates with the OS to handle the interrupt. 
The configuration for our interrupt happens in the \textit{GPIOF\_Interrupt\_Init} branch. 

Like above, this used the \textit{LDR, MOV, and ORR} commands among others, to set different values. Part of the process is setting certain bits to 1 to enable the GPIO port we need for the led to function. 

\paragraph{}
While there are more parts to initializing the GPIO ports, those were the main functions. Now that we have a brief explanation about initializing the interrupts, back to the vector table. The vector table is like a directory,

\paragraph{}
Throughout the program, you see PUSH \{LR\} and POP \{LR\}. \{LR\} is the link register, in simple terms, this register contains information about where to return to when a function finishes. If my understanding is correct, in \textit{GPIOPortF\_Handler} it pushes the LR onto the stack to store it for when this interrupt is complete. Once it's done, it pops it off the stack, and branches to LR. IF my understanding of this lab and architecture is true, the stack is used with interrupts to store where to return to when an interrupt occurs and is processed. This is to ensure that the computer resumes processing from where it left off when the interrupt occurred. Since, as the name implies, it interrupted normal execution. 

\paragraph{}
As you may of picked up on, interrupts allow a computer do practically do multiple things at once, even with only one processing core. While not technically at once, the process of Context switching is what enables this. Without context switching, your computer could only do one thing at a time, it could process a thing, then respond to input, etc. This sounds like a pretty miserable way to use a computer. Luckily, computers can do small task very quickly, so context switching has a computer perform a small task, then switch to another small task, and with enough of these switches, you have the illusion of a multitasking computer. Above is a form of context switching, the handler interrupts the normal flow of the hardware, the hardware gives control to the handler, which then using the LR register stores it, does it's own actions, and switches context back to the previous program by popping the LR register.
